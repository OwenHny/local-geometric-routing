# Block 1 (Jan 8 - 20 )

Started the implementation of graph generation

Read papers on geometric routing and falmilarized myself with the algorithms

# Block 2 (Jan 22 - Feb 3)

Implemented one bit routing
Implementation of graph generation

# Block 3 (Feb 5 - 16)

Investigated and Considered what it means for an algoritm to be stuck
Verified that the graphs being generated are valid 

Started implementing face routing
Created "left" routing

# Block 4 (Feb 19 - Mar 8)

Finished implementing face routing

Found and read papers applying an efficent routing strategy with a guaranteed method as recovery

Generated graphs
Started running tests

# Block 5 (Mar 11 - 22)
Read papers applying an efficent routing strategy with a guaranteed method as recovery

Implemented Void routing on non planar graphs
Tested all routing implementations

Ran more routing performance tests
Started compiling notes and writing the paper

# Block 6 (Mar 25 - April 5)

Continuing tests, and visualizing results
Writing Paper

Creating presentaion 

# Block 7 (April 8 - April 19)

Finishing and giving presentation
Writing paper
Finalizing results

Finishing paper
